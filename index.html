                BIDAA Welfare has provided a platform that has facilitated in reaching 1,000 + needy children aged between 3 - 21 years
                old across the country. Moreover, BIDAA has not only provided a platform to help needy children but also a safe space, a
                place for them to feel loved and share the challenges they face. Consequently, we have managed to get multiple kids off
                the streets and given them reasons to start of to brighter futures.

                    Just like the name suggests, stretch a hand initiative is aimed towards reaching out to the streets kids and showing some
                    love. This campaign’s main objective is to clean the Kenyan streets and help shelter these less fortunate children. As
                    unknown to many, these children also have dreams and ambitions, all they need is the support towards achieving them.
                    Therefore Stretch A Hand Initiative is determined to get these young talents off the streets and steer them towards
                    realising their lifetime dreams.

                  This project’s main objective is to cushion needy orphans’ living standards across the nation. Most of them having lost
                  their parents at a tender age, it is ample to look out for them and help them at least acquire the basic human needs.
                  This project is sponsored by a couple of human welfare organizations and could also use the little donation you make
                  towards helping this group of children.
